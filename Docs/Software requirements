User requirements, Functional, non-Functional

**Purpose
The Purpose of this project is to build source to source compiler which is a compiler that takes
  a source code from one language and rewrite the code into another source code of the target language
This kind of system software can be usefull in cases like the following:
  - Running old or lagacy code on modern machines / compilers and with modern architecture
  - Testing new programming language before implementing compiler ( to machine code )
  - Adding new features to a programming language in early phase before completely delploy
  the features.
  - Example: python2 to python3

we are building Basic to C++ compiler.
  The reason of choosing both of these languages is that both are well documented and both have clear and well estableshed
  grammer which we can work with.

**Scope
This project is intended to develop a compiler that supports basic features of a high-level
  programming language such as variables, data types, expressions, statements and control structures
  the data types supported are strings and double.
  The compiler will not support advanced features such as classes, inheritance, functions,
    polymorphism or exception handling.


** Objectives
The objectives of this project are to:
  - Develop a compiler that can translate source code written in a high-level
  programming language into another high level language.
  - Ensure that the compiler produces correct target code that conforms to the syntax and 
  semantics of the source language.
  - Provide a user-friendly interface and documentation for using the compiler.
  - Complete the project within the budget and schedule constraints.

**Assumptions
The assumptions for this project are: 
  - The source language is well-defined and has a formal grammar and semantics. 
  - The target platform and instruction set architecture are stable and well-documented. 
  - The users of the compiler have basic knowledge of programming and computer systems.‚Äù

**Constraints
The constraints for this project are: 
  - The compiler must be written in C++ programming language. 
  - The compiler should run on Linux operating system.
  - The compiler must comply with relevant standards and regulations.
  - C++ compler should exist on target machine ( clang++ )
